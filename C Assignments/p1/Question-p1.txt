P1:-

Write a C Program in which we use 8 LEDâ€™s and 4 Switches in such a way that when we press SW1 LED1 and LED2 should glow for a 1sec and then should be off.
Similarly if we press SW2, LED3 and LED4 should glow, if SW3 then LED5 and LED6 and if SW4 then LED7 and LED8. Use Timer1 to generate the delay.
(You may use timer1 in over flow mode or CTC mode).
